## Introduction

This is my first blog post! I'm going to show you some Python code.

## Basic Python Example

Here's a simple Python function:
```{python}
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

result = greet("World")
print(result)
```

## Working with Data

You can also work with data structures:
```{python}
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = [x**2 for x in numbers]
print(f"Original: {numbers}")
print(f"Squared: {squared}")
```

## Conclusion

That's it! You now know how to write blog posts with Quarto.
