    "text": "High-revisit Imaging\nWhen considering sub-meter, high resolution imagery, optimizing revisit frequency directly increases revenue per satellite asset for several important applications.\nFirstly, some applications are inherently time sensitive: agriculture, deforestation monitoring, and disaster response require timely updates on the order of minutes for critical decisions to be made. An example would be the detection of man-made fires in the forests of Riau, Indonesia - an area spanning over 80,000 square kilometers - authorities need to know where to deploy their limited resources to combat this illegal farming practice before further harm occurs.\nSecondly, applications in predictive analytics and anomaly detection require multiple satellite images of a location to build up a baseline pattern-of-life. A short temporal sampling period on the order of hours would provide information on intra-day patterns - particularly useful for urban areas.\nFinally, advanced imagery products such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) tomography or interferometry require the acquisition of images in a short timeframe, to minimise temporal decorrelation of the scene."

    "text": "Mixed Sensor Constellations\nMixed sensor constellations can be used to meet a single mission objective, often to better results than a homogeneous sensor constellation. For example, a mix of SAR and Electro-Optical (EO) sensors would be complementary in surveillance applications - EO providing easily-interpretable daytime imagery, and the active SAR sensor providing that all-weather, day-or-night imaging capability.\nThe benefits of mixed sensor constellations are not without its operational drawbacks. Operating multiple sensors - especially from different vendors - would imply dealing with different tasking workflows or different satellite constraints. This increases the cognitive load on the operator, particularly when the time pressure of high-revisit imaging is involved."

    "text": "Putting It Together: The Mixed Sensor Constellation Scheduling Problem\nFrom our earlier discussions, a practical optimisation problem emerges: using a (potentially heterogeneous) constellation of satellite sensors, how can an operator find the optimal sequence of imaging tasks to yield high-revisit rates over a (long) list of Areas Of Interest (AOIs)?\nIn practice, AOIs evolve or are replaced with other locations over time. Sensors come online, or become unavailable due to maintenance downtime. This implies that an optimal task schedule is not produced once, but optimised for on a regular basis. In the extreme case, operators might be attempting to solve the scheduling problem at every orbital period - some assistance and automation is clearly required."

Here we will make heavy use of the binomial coefficient formula to determine how many combinations are possible when picking \\(r\\) numbers from a set of \\(n\\) numbers. The formula is:\n\\[\nC(n,r)=\\frac{n\\times(n-1)\\times  \\dots\\times (n-r+1)}{r \\times (r-1) \\times \\dots  \\times 1}\n\\]\nThe number of combinations for a single TOTO ticket of six numbers is \\(C(49,6)=13,983,816\\).\nWith reference to the prize structure table above, lets calculate the number of combinations to win Group 7. First you would need to match three of the six winning numbers, so \\(C(6,3)=20\\). Then not match the additional number, so \\(C(1,0)=1\\). You still have to fill your ticket with three more numbers, which can be any combination of the 42 remaining undrawn numbers, so \\(C(42,3)=11,480\\). Hence, the number of ways you can win Group 7 is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Ways to Win Group 7} = C(6,3)\\times C(1,0) \\times C(42,3)=229,600\n\\]\nThe probability of winning Group 7 is the number of ways to win it divided by the total possible ways to form a TOTO ticket, so \\(229600/13983816 = 1.64\\%\\)\nLets do the same calculation for all the prize groups.\n\n\n\nGroup\nNumber of Ways to Win the Group\nProbability \\(P(Win_i)\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n\\(C(6,6)\\times C(1,0) \\times C(42,0)=1\\)\n0.000007 %\n\n\n2\n\\(C(6,5)\\times C(1,1) \\times C(42,0)=6\\)\n0.00004 %\n\n\n3\n\\(C(6,5)\\times C(1,0) \\times C(42,1)=252\\)\n0.0018 %\n\n\n4\n\\(C(6,4)\\times C(1,1) \\times C(42,1)=630\\)\n0.0045 %\n\n\n5\n\\(C(6,4)\\times C(1,0) \\times C(42,2)=12915\\)\n0.0924 %\n\n\n6\n\\(C(6,3)\\times C(1,1) \\times C(42,2)=17220\\)\n0.1231 %\n\n\n7\n\\(C(6,3)\\times C(1,0) \\times C(42,3)=229600\\)\n1.6419 %\n\n\n\nSumming the probabilities, the chance of winning any prize is approximately 1.84%.

    "section": "Hot and Cold Numbers",
    "text": "Hot and Cold Numbers\nOne method of picking TOTO numbers is based off the frequency they are drawn. Some people think numbers that occur more frequently will continue to occur frequently (hot), while others think numbers that occur less frequently are due to appear soon (cold).\nBut what is “more” or “less” frequent?\nTo determine if a number occurs more or less frequently, we have to compare it to some expected frequency. Lets work out what this expected frequency is.\nFor a number \\(i\\), the probability of \\(i\\) being drawn is \\(P(i \\text{ is drawn}) = 7/49\\), because there are 7 chances to draw a number, and there are 49 TOTO numbers. There are two possible outcomes for the number \\(i\\), drawn or not drawn. This means that each number follows a binomial distribution.\nThrough careful inspection of the 49 balls in the cool glass contraption in the image above, we can hypothesize that each number is equally likely to be drawn. Furthermore, picking a number \\(i\\) does not affect the probability of picking a number \\(j\\), so all 49 TOTO numbers are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d).\nFor a binomial distribution, the average or expected frequency is \\(np\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of TOTO lottery draws (1154 in our dataset), and \\(p = P(i \\text{ is drawn}) = 7/49\\). Then the expected frequency is:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[i \\text{ is drawn in dataset}] = np = 1154\\times 7/49=164.86\n\\]\nLets see what the data shows.\n\n\n\nNumber frequency distribution showing hot and cold numbers\n\n\nHere we see a plot for all 49 TOTO numbers on the horizontal axis, and the number of occurrences on the vertical axis. The red horizontal line depicts the expected number of occurrences for the dataset (164.86). Hot numbers appear above the line, Cold numbers appear below the line.\nThe top 6 hottest and coldest numbers are labelled for you lucky cats out there.\nIs the data statistically significant?\nBefore you rush off to dump your life savings into the next TOTO draw, lets check whether the variation we are seeing could be explainable by the variance in the underlying probability distribution. The variance of a binomial distribution is calculated as:\n\\[\nVar[i\\text{ is drawn in dataset}] = np(1-p) = 1154 \\times 7/49 \\times 42/49 = 141.3\n\\]\nAnd the standard deviation is thus \\(\\sigma_n=\\sqrt{141.3}=11.88\\). For the “hottest” TOTO number 15 appearing 189 times in the dataset means that it is \\((189-164.86)/11.88 = 2.03\\sigma\\), or approximately 2 standard deviations from the mean.\nIn other words, if a TOTO number truly does follow a binomial distribution (and the number of TOTO draws is large like in our dataset here), then we would expect occurrences of \\(2\\sigma\\) to appear approximately 5% of the time, or 2 to 3 of the 49 TOTO numbers. Indeed, the data shows TOTO numbers 15 and 45 are the two numbers that deviate by \\(\\geq2\\sigma\\).\nDoubling Down… on Math\n“But wait!” you say, putting your TOTO tickets aside for a moment. “That’s just back-of-the-envelope math, and all I have is this TOTO ticket to scribble on! Maybe there are other hot or cold numbers?”\nYou’re right, we’ve only looked at the hottest and coldest numbers so far. A complementary check we could perform would be the Chi-Square Test, denoted by the formula\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{49}\\frac{(o_i - e_i)^2}{e_i}\n\\]\nWhere \\(o_i\\) and \\(e_i\\) are the observed and expected number of occurrences for the TOTO number \\(i\\) respectively.\nWhile previously we were looking at individual outlying TOTO numbers, here the Chi-Square test checks all 49 TOTO numbers to see if each and every TOTO number follows a binomial distribution. More specifically, the value of \\(\\chi^2\\) represents the sum of deviations from the expected occurrences, which can be checked against the Chi-Square distribution to obtain the probability that all TOTO numbers have a fair chance of being drawn (which we call the null hypothesis).\nFrom calculation, \\(\\chi^2=32.73\\), and with \\(49-1=48\\) degrees of freedom, the p-value obtained is \\(95.48\\%\\) (probability of the dataset representing samples of a fair TOTO draw).\nUnfortunately, the data shows that TOTO is very likely not rigged, and every TOTO number has an equally likely probability of occurring.\nA Slight Detour into Psychology\nGambling is interesting to me because its analysis sits at the intersection of math and psychology. This perception of hot and cold numbers has been comprehensively documented under the term “The Gambler’s Fallacy”. The little voice in our head insisting that previously absent numbers should appear soon suggests some link between previous TOTO draws and current ones. That the mathematical reality is that each draw is independent from past and future draws also requires some manner of belief; in the infallible logic of math."

    "text": "But wait, I have a SYSTEM!\nWe’ve already shown that the TOTO game is mathematically fair, with strong evidence from the 15 years of historical results. That does not mean that TOTO is impossible to win, merely that any combination of six TOTO numbers are equally likely to win. And for some people, spending a dollar to “buy hope” (买希望 in mandarin) is still worth it. Lets conclude this section with some data visualisation. Instead of letting the TOTO system pick numbers for you at random, maybe you can use the figure below to pick for yourself. But really, I just want to show you some colourful plots I made.\nThe system I propose is based on co-occurrence, and is detailed as follows:\n\nStarting from a hand-picked initial number \\(a\\), you find the most commonly paired number \\(b\\).\nFrom \\(b\\), find the next most commonly paired number \\(c\\).\nRepeat until you get all six numbers for your TOTO ticket\nProfit???\n\nLets first visualise the co-occurrences of every pair of numbers in a heatmap plot. The plot is symmetrical about its diagonal, because the number of occurrences for TOTO number pair \\((a,b)\\) is the same as pair \\((b,a)\\). The diagonal for pair \\((a,a)\\) is ignored and arbitrarily set to 0. Green boxes indicate pairs that are drawn frequently, while red boxes indicate rarely drawn pairs.\n\n\n\nHeatmap of co-occurrence between TOTO number pairs\n\n\nWe should also note that all pairs have been seen at least once. The actual co-occurrence ranges from 9 to 40.\nThe heatmap contains useful information, but is difficult to read in detail. We can visualise it as a network graph, with each node representing a single TOTO number. Connections (i.e. edges) between the TOTO numbers represent pairs, and the closer the nodes are to each other, the more frequently the corresponding pairs occur in the dataset. The larger the node, the more connections it has.\nNote that we are only displaying the top 20% of edges, because the graph is fully connected and the visualisation would be really challenging to read otherwise.\n\n\n\nNetwork graph showing TOTO number co-occurrence relationships\n\n\nNow we are ready to pick numbers. Starting from your favourite number, traverse the network until you get all six TOTO numbers on your ticket. If you selected each node based on node size, this means you now have the most historically frequent set of numbers which also include your favourite number!\nReminder: past performance does not guarantee future performance, and this system is by no means mathematically optimal. Although if you do win, please consider buying me a coffee (with a sprinkling of gold flakes and diamonds in it)."

    "section": "Loss Conditions for Singapore Pools",
    "text": "Loss Conditions for Singapore Pools\nLets first define losses to Singapore Pools, then we can find the conditions in which they occur.\nDefinition 1: For a given TOTO draw, the total payouts exceed the allotted 54.5% of total sales. This is the “weak” version of loss, since it just means Singapore Pools obtains less income for that draw.\nDefinition 2: For a given TOTO draw, the total payouts exceed total sales. This is the “strong” version of loss, since Singapore Pools experienced negative income and would have to dig into their treasury to service the payouts owed to the ticket winners.\n\nConditions for “Weak” Loss\nInspecting the TOTO rules, there are two scenarios in which Singapore Pools would suffer a weak loss. Some combination of these scenarios would be required for a weak loss per draw.\n\nTicket sales are so low for a draw that Singapore Pools have to top up the Group 1 prize in order to meet the minimum amount of \\(1M. This occurs when\\) &lt; 10^6$ \\((N\\times 0.545) \\times 0.38 &lt; 10^6\\) \\(N &lt; 4,828,585 \\text{ tickets}\\)\nThe total (fixed amount) payouts for groups 5 to 7 exceed the allotted amount of 24.80% of total sales, requiring payouts taken from the 45.5% of total sales skimmed off for Singapore Pool’s income (this scenario assumes groups 1-4 are paid out as well). \\(0.248 N &lt; Payout_{5,6,7} &lt; 0.703N\\)\n\nBefore we can analyse the data, we need to create the required features first. The dataset only provides Group \\(i\\) payouts and number of winners - thankfully, we have sufficient information to find the ticket sales (i.e. the value of \\(N\\)). Within the time range of the dataset, there has always been at least one winner in group 3, meaning the prize payouts have never been rolled over (“snowballed”). Knowing that group 3 is paidout 3% of total sales, we can find \\(N=Prize_3 / 0.03\\).\n\n\nHistorical Occurrences of “Weak” Loss\nCondition 1: Low Ticket Sales\nNow, lets see if condition 1 for weak loss has ever occurred in our dataset. In the following figure, we plot the total sales amount, compared against the $4.8M sales threshold where topup of group 1 prize is required.\n\n\n\nTicket sales over time with $4.8M threshold indicated\n\n\nIn total, 12 draws were found that required topup. 10 of those draws occurred in the period of July to September 2020, which was the year when Singapore locked down for Covid-19. Looks like Singaporeans were sensible enough to prioritise their health over queueing for a TOTO ticket in those tumultuous times.\n2 July 2020 marked the lowest total sales in the history of the updated game at only $4.05M. Singapore Pools had to topup $161K into the group 1 prize amount. (Unfortunately, no one won the group 1 prize on that draw)\nCondition 2: Many Group 5 to 7 Winners\nSince the prize pool is 54.5% of total sales, and groups 1 to 4 are allocated 54.5% of the prize pool, it follows that groups 5 to 7 are allocated the remaining 45.5% of the prize pool.\n\n\n\nPrize pool allocation between prize groups over time\n\n\nFrom the dataset, 43% of the TOTO draws see Singapore Pools suffering a weak loss. In draws where Singapore Pools loses, we also see larger variance in the payouts, such as 2 May 2016 where group 5 to 7 payouts exceeded 90% of the total prize pool.\nInterestingly, the average payouts for groups 5 to 7 across the dataset is 46.1% of the price pool, which is 0.6% above the allocated payout amount.\nBoth Conditions Combined\nThe actual impact of a weak loss can be measured when we assess both conditions as a whole. This is achieved by plotting the payouts for all groups as a percentage of total sales. With reference to the TOTO rules, Singapore Pools expects the sum of all payouts to be ≤54.5% of total sales.\n\n\n\nTotal payouts as percentage of sales showing Singapore Pools win/loss ratio\n\n\nHere we see that Singapore Pools win 61% of the draws (win meaning it takes more than the expected 54.5% as income), an increase from the 56% house-win rate from condition 2. This is likely due to the draws where groups 1 to 4 do not have any winners - the savings from not having to payout those larger prizes offsets the small-prize payouts of groups 5 to 7.\nNote also that there have been no payouts &gt;100% of total sales, which means that Singapore Pools have never experienced the “strong” definition of loss in any draw. By this definition of loss, Singapore Pools (a.k.a. “the House”) has indeed always won.\nYear-on-Year Income\nThus far we have been analysing the dataset per-draw, whereas corporate accounting typically analyses the income on an annual basis.\n\n\n\nYear-on-year actual vs expected income for Singapore Pools\n\n\nIn this figure, we see Singapore Pools’ actual income versus expected income (45% of total sales) for each full year, from 2015 to 2025. The difference between actual and expected income is also plotted in the red lineplot. 7 out of the 10 years assessed showed lower-than-expected income, indicating weak loss.\n\n\nConditions for “Strong” Loss\nFrom analysis of the data, we now know that total payouts have never exceeded total sales per draw - Singapore Pools have never experienced a strong loss. But could it though? Are there conditions that increase the probability of a strong loss occurring?\nRecall that the condition for a strong loss is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^7 \\text{payout}_i &gt; N\n\\]\nWhere \\(N\\) is ticket sales ($1 per ticket), and \\(i\\) represents the prize group number.\nSince groups 1 to 4 prizes are defined as a function of the prize pool, payouts will never exceed the allocation (ignoring the $1M topup rule for simplicity).\nIt thus falls to groups 5 to 7 with fixed prizes to win more than their allocation, expressed as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=5}^7 \\text{payout}_i &gt; N -\\sum_{i=1}^4 \\text{payout}_i\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=5}^7 \\text{payout}_i &gt; N -(N\\times 0.545 \\times 0.545)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=5}^7 \\text{payout}_i &gt; 0.703N\n\\]\nLets re-write \\(\\text{payout}_i\\) to be more explicit.\n\\[\n50W_5 + 25W_6 + 10W_7 &gt; 0.703N\n\\]\nWhere \\(W_i\\) represents the number of winning tickets per group \\(i\\), multiplied by the fixed prize payouts for each group.\nWe should also note that \\(W_i=X_1 + X_2 + \\dots + X_N\\), where each \\(X_k \\in [0,1]\\) is an indicator variable on whether ticket \\(k\\) has won in group \\(i\\). This implies that \\(X_k\\) is a Bernoulli random variable, and \\(W_i\\) thus follows a Binomial distribution.\nBut if \\(N\\) is large enough, then Central Limit Theorem allows us to treat \\(W_i\\) as normally distributed! The rule of thumb here is \\(Np\\geq 10\\) and \\(N(1-p)\\geq 10\\). Lets check this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup \\(i\\)\nLowest recorded \\(N\\)\n\\(p_i=P(Win_i)\\)\n\\(Np_i\\)\n\\(N(1-p_i)\\)\n\n\n\n\n5\n4048473\n0.00092357\n3739\n4044733\n\n\n6\n4048473\n0.00123142\n4985\n4043487\n\n\n7\n4048473\n0.01641898\n66471\n3982001\n\n\n\nSince \\(Np &gt;&gt;10\\) and \\(N(1-p) &gt;&gt; 10\\), it’s safe to proceed with Central Limit Theorem!\n\\(W_i\\) is approximately normal, with mean \\(\\mu_i=\\mathbb{E}[Win_i]\\) and variance \\(\\sigma_i^2=Np_i(1-p_i)\\).\nAnd by extension, fixed prize payouts \\(50W_5 + 25W_6 + 10W_7\\) are also normally distributed, with mean \\(\\mu=\\sum_{i=5}^7\\mathbb{E}[Win_i]\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2=\\sum_{i=5}^7Np_i(1-p_i)\\).\nLets expand the terms.\n\\[\n\\mu = 50Np_5 + 25Np_6 + 10Np_7 = 0.241N\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = 50^2Np_5(1-p_5)+25^2Np_6(1-p_6) + 10^2Np_7(1-p_7) = 4.69N\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\sigma^2}=2.17\\sqrt{N}\n\\]\nHaving approximated the fixed price payouts as normally distributed, we can find the Z-score via conversion to a standard normal distribution. The strong loss threshold we are looking at is \\(0.703N\\), which converts to the Z-threshold as \\(\\frac{0.703N-\\mu}{\\sigma} = 0.213\\sqrt{N}\\)\nTo be clear, we have made the equivalence that \\(P(payout &gt; 0.703N) = P(Z &gt; 0.213\\sqrt{N})\\)\nWhat’s the probability of strong loss occurring?\nWell, it depends. In the following figure we plot the probability \\(P(Z &gt; 0.213\\sqrt{N})\\) for varying values of \\(N\\).\n\n\n\nProbability of strong loss occurring as a function of ticket sales\n\n\nNote that the probability of a strong loss occurring increases as ticket sales decreases. This probability drops below 5% after 60 tickets have been sold, and below 1% after 120 tickets. That’s a “sure win” for Singapore Pools to me.\nBut wait! How is it that when ticket sales are smaller, there’s a higher probability of Singapore Pools suffering a strong loss? That’s confusing.\n\n\n\ncredit: Crystal_ YouTube\n\n\nBut here’s the thing: Singapore Pools suffers a strong loss as a proportion of \\(N\\).\n\\[\n\\text{Strong Loss Occurs} \\rightarrow \\text{Payout Groups 5 to 7} &gt; 0.703N\n\\]\nEquivalently,\n\\[\n\\text{Payout Groups 5 to 7}/N &gt; 0.703\n\\]\nThe average payout for fixed prize groups just has to be larger than 70.3cents.\nNote also that the standard deviation reduces as \\(N\\) increases.\n\nStandard deviation of fixed prize payouts by ticket sales\n\n\n\\(N\\)\n\\(\\sigma = 2.17\\sqrt{N}\\)\n\n\n\n\n100\n$0.217\n\n\n10,000\n$0.0217\n\n\n1,000,000\n$0.00068\n\n\n\nSo the “spread” about the mean actually reduces when \\(N\\) is large, meaning it gets harder to achieve that 70.3 cents per ticket payout. That’s some 200IQ play, Singapore Pools."

    "text": "So, When Does the House Lose?\nYou can make this happen! Don’t pray play to the TOTO god. When ticket sales are low enough, there is (A) a certainty that Singapore Pools will have to top up the group 1 prize, and (B) a greater chance that fixed prize payouts exceed the total prize pool.\nWill this ever happen? I doubt so. Even if ticket sales are abnormally low, Singapore Pools can top up the prize pool (to beyond $1M), thus incentivising more players into the draw and stacking the odds in their favour."

    "text": "credit: muvamo.com\n\n\nOver a year ago, my wife and I moved from Singapore to Vienna. While settling down in this new city, I found time to read more, think more, and code more. With the freedom to explore, I found myself easily excited with every new idea I encountered. Looking back on 2025, I realised that I started many projects, but rarely finished any (satisfactorily). I needed a better system. Hence, this hastily constructed static page I proudly call my blog.\nThis blog is a place for me to put my thoughts down, and hopefully a place for you to pick something up. Here’s to completing more projects in the coming yea-"
